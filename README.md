# liri-node-app

This is my objective for the liri-node-app: 

In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

Instructions:
This application searches the API's of Spotify, Bands in Town, and OMB for the appropriate commands using NODE.js. 
In the command line of your terminal, using NODE.js, you will call the functions that you want to use:
concert-this;
spotify-this-song;
movie-this; 
and do-what-it-says 
The functions call the appropriate information and will display the console log to the user.
